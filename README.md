# Binary Search

Idea is to find a monotonic search space. Perform operations (include or reject) on the search space accordingly. Search space implies the space where your answer might lie. Another pointer is make sure your search space is within the range (if you apply BS on problems other than involving arrays). If it's not within the integer limit, handle accordingly.
Funny thing we miss: If you find an answer within your search space, the part to the left or to the right will all be the answers (monotonic). You just have to pick the most suitable according to the problem asked.
